# Monitoring COVID-19 cases growth in Italy

I simply took a cue from [aatishb](https://github.com/aatishb/covidtrends), adapting it in Python and building an interactive graph/animation that shows the trajectory of COVID-19 cases in Italy by region.
The graph plots the number of new confirmed cases in the past week vs the total number of confirmed cases.

Tips: 
- Play/Pause button
- move the slider to see daily changes
- hover over the graph for more info
- scroll to zoom into graph
- use dropdown menus to switch logarithmic - linear scale
